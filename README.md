## Gunracks Racketscript Autobuilder

So far: not much. It just watches your files and recompiles them as
they change or get added, and it doesn't do that well.

## To Do:

1. Improve watching.
2. Implement live reload.
3. Choose between CLI tool or web-server library.

## Improve Racketscript:

1. Contracts!
2. Typed Racketscript?
3. Source maps!
